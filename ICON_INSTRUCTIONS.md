## Icon Design Tips

**Good app icons are:**
- ✅ Simple (1-2 colors max)
- ✅ Recognizable at small sizes
- ✅ Square with rounded corners optional
- ✅ No text (icon only)
- ✅ High contrast

**Bad app icons:**
- ❌ Too detailed
- ❌ Text-heavy
- ❌ Photos (unless very simple)
- ❌ Long aspect ratio (not square)

## For Flânerie, Consider:

- 🧭 Compass
- 🗺️ Map pin
- 🌆 City skyline
- 👣 Footprints
- 🎯 Location marker

**Color scheme:**
